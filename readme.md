## Reflection

### Challenges Faced

- **Single-file constraint:** All logic, styles, and markup are in one file, which can make maintenance harder.
- **No backend:** Data is stored in-memory, so changes are lost on refresh.
- **Form validation:** Ensuring robust validation for all fields and edge cases.

### Improvements for Future

- **Persistent storage:** Integrate with a backend or use browser storage (localStorage) to save employee data.
- **Modular codebase:** Split code into separate HTML, CSS, and JS files for better maintainability.
- **Accessibility:** Improve ARIA roles and keyboard navigation.
- **Testing:** Add automated tests for UI and logic.
- **Bulk actions:** Support for importing/exporting employee data.
